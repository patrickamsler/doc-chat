Similarly to how in the 2010s IBM tried to market\\nthe term “cognitive computing” to stand out from competition, in the 1960s, IBM used the\\nnew cool term “machine learning” to attract both clients and talented employees.\\nAs you can see, just like artiﬁcial intelligence is not intelligence, machine learning is not\\nlearning. However, machine learning is a universally recognized term that usually refers\\nto the science and engineering of building machines capable of doing various useful things\\nwithout being explicitly programmed to do so. So, the word “learning” in the term is used\\nby analogy with the learning in animals rather than literally.'"
